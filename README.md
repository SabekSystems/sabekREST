**API Characteristics:**

500 - indicates a serverside issue, contact webmaster
```

### Response

Responses will be sent in the form:

```js
{
  "status": 200,
  "data": [
    {
      "message_id": "S6767882hk"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where status is the HTTP response code and data/message is the response body
